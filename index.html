    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi!I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at Santa Clara University. Iâ€™ve specialized in Analytics, by interning in various roles, including as a Business Intelligence Engineer, Business Analyst, Business Consultant, Data Analyst, and Business Strategist. This summer, I interned at ServiceNow as a Business Strategy Specialist. I also recently completed a Data Analyst internship at Teladoc Health during the winter.

In my free time, I enjoy working on self-paced projects, studying Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to stay ahead of the curve to make sure I can leverage these innovations in my work. Beyond my professional interests, I am a dancer, pianist, and equestrian. I love exploring new recreational pursuits, discovering new places, and expanding my network.
